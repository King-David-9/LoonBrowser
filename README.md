LoonBrowser GitHub Installation Guide
This guide provides clear instructions for installing LoonBrowser from GitHub for both Windows and Linux/macOS users.
Prerequisites

Git
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (included with Node.js)

Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository
bashCopy# Create a directory for your projects if you don't have one
mkdir -p ~/projects

# Navigate to your projects directory
cd ~/projects

# Clone the LoonBrowser repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoonBrowser.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd LoonBrowser
2. Install Dependencies
bashCopy# Install all required dependencies
npm install
3. Start the Application
bashCopy# Start the LoonBrowser application
npm start
Platform-Specific Notes
Windows
If using Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell:
Copycd C:\path\to\projects
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoonBrowser.git
cd LoonBrowser
npm install
npm start
Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
If you're using WSL, you'll need to run the application from Windows, not from WSL:

Clone the repository using WSL:
bashCopycd /mnt/c/path/to/projects
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoonBrowser.git

Then open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
Copycd C:\path\to\projects\LoonBrowser
npm install
npm start


Linux and macOS
The general instructions should work without modification. If you encounter permission issues:
bashCopy# Make sure you have permission to execute scripts
chmod +x src/main.js

# If you encounter permission issues with npm
sudo npm install -g npm  # Update npm globally
Troubleshooting
Common Issues

"Cannot find module" error:

Verify that you're in the correct directory (the one containing package.json)
Make sure you've run npm install
Check if src/main.js exists


"Error launching app" or "Cannot find Electron":

Make sure Electron is properly installed: npm install electron --save-dev
Check if the "main" entry in package.json points to the correct file


WSL Display Issues:

Electron applications should be run from Windows, not from WSL
If you must use WSL, configure X11 forwarding or install VcXsrv


Module Not Found Errors:

If specific modules are missing, install them individually:

Copynpm install missing-module-name


Project Structure
The LoonBrowser project has the following structure:
CopyLoonBrowser/
├── package.json        # Project configuration and dependencies
├── src/
│   ├── main.js         # Main Electron process
│   ├── index.html      # Main browser UI
│   └── ...             # Other source files
├── assets/             # Images, icons, and other assets
└── ...
Make sure that you run commands from the root directory (the one containing package.json).
Building for Distribution
To build the application for distribution:
bashCopy# For your current platform
npm run build

# For specific platforms
npm run build:win    # Windows
npm run build:mac    # macOS
npm run build:linux  # Linux
The built applications will be available in the dist directory.
Development vs Production
This installation guide focuses on setting up LoonBrowser for development. For production use, you should:

Build the application using the build commands
Distribute the packaged application rather than running from source

# Custom Web Browser Project

This project aims to develop a custom web browser with advanced features similar to Brave, Arc, or Firefox. The development process follows a structured approach outlined in the project flowchart.

## Getting Started

There are two parallel paths you can take to start development:

### 1. Electron-based Quick Start

This approach gets you a working browser shell quickly using Electron, which is based on Chromium:

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir electron-browser
cd electron-browser

# Initialize a new Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install required dependencies
npm install electron electron-tabs
```

Then, create the main files:
- `main.js` - The main Electron process
- `index.html` - The browser UI

Run the browser with:
```bash
npx electron .
```

This approach lets you quickly prototype UI concepts and basic browser functionality.

### 2. Full Chromium Build (Long-term approach)

For a more comprehensive browser, you'll need to build on top of Chromium:

```bash
# Go to your WSL Ubuntu environment
# Follow the setup instructions in the chromium-setup.sh script
```

This approach takes longer to set up but gives you more control over the browser's core functionality.

## Development Roadmap

The development process should follow these phases as outlined in the flowchart:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define requirements
   - Design browser architecture
   - Select technology stack
   - Prioritize features
   - Consider legal compliance

2. **Rendering Engine Decision**
   - Choose between Chromium, WebKit, Gecko, or custom
   - Set up development environment for the chosen engine

3. **Core Development**
   - Implement core components:
     - User interface
     - Tab management
     - Bookmarks & history
     - Privacy features
     - Extensions support
     - Data synchronization

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Ad blocking
   - Tracker prevention
   - Workspaces/containers
   - Custom CSS/themes
   - AI integration
   - PWA support

5. **Integration & Services**
   - Cloud sync service
   - Usage analytics
   - Update system
   - Monetization strategy

6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security audits
   - User testing
   - Cross-platform testing

7. **Release & Distribution**
   - Alpha release
   - Beta release
   - Public release
   - App store distribution
   - Website downloads
   - Package managers

8. **Maintenance & Growth**
   - Bug fixes
   - Feature updates

# Loon Browser

![Loon Browser](assets/loon-browser-logo.svg)

Loon Browser is a Minnesota-themed web browser with advanced features similar to Brave, Arc, or Firefox. Named after Minnesota's state bird, the Common Loon, our browser aims to provide a unique browsing experience that is fast, privacy-focused, and distinctly Minnesotan.

The development process follows a structured approach outlined in the project flowchart.
