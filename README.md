Address bar with search integration
Settings and preferences panel


### Privacy Features

Ad blocking capability
Tracker prevention
Private browsing mode


### Advanced Features

Workspace/container tabs (similar to Arc)
Custom CSS/themes support
Extension support
Data synchronization across devices



### Technical Considerations

Rendering Engine: Decision needed (Chromium, WebKit, Gecko, or custom)
Programming Languages: C++, JavaScript, Rust consideration
UI Framework: Electron, Qt, or custom
Performance Targets: Time to first paint < 2s, smooth 60fps scrolling

## Legal Compliance

GDPR compliance for European users
CCPA compliance for California users
Transparent data collection policies


# Custom Web Browser Project

This project aims to develop a custom web browser with advanced features similar to Brave, Arc, or Firefox. The development process follows a structured approach outlined in the project flowchart.

## Getting Started

There are two parallel paths you can take to start development:

### 1. Electron-based Quick Start

This approach gets you a working browser shell quickly using Electron, which is based on Chromium:

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir electron-browser
cd electron-browser

# Initialize a new Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install required dependencies
npm install electron electron-tabs
```

Then, create the main files:
- `main.js` - The main Electron process
- `index.html` - The browser UI

Run the browser with:
```bash
npx electron .
```

This approach lets you quickly prototype UI concepts and basic browser functionality.

### 2. Full Chromium Build (Long-term approach)

For a more comprehensive browser, you'll need to build on top of Chromium:

```bash
# Go to your WSL Ubuntu environment
# Follow the setup instructions in the chromium-setup.sh script
```

This approach takes longer to set up but gives you more control over the browser's core functionality.

## Development Roadmap

The development process should follow these phases as outlined in the flowchart:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define requirements
   - Design browser architecture
   - Select technology stack
   - Prioritize features
   - Consider legal compliance

2. **Rendering Engine Decision**
   - Choose between Chromium, WebKit, Gecko, or custom
   - Set up development environment for the chosen engine

3. **Core Development**
   - Implement core components:
     - User interface
     - Tab management
     - Bookmarks & history
     - Privacy features
     - Extensions support
     - Data synchronization

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Ad blocking
   - Tracker prevention
   - Workspaces/containers
   - Custom CSS/themes
   - AI integration
   - PWA support

5. **Integration & Services**
   - Cloud sync service
   - Usage analytics
   - Update system
   - Monetization strategy

6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security audits
   - User testing
   - Cross-platform testing

7. **Release & Distribution**
   - Alpha release
   - Beta release
   - Public release
   - App store distribution
   - Website downloads
   - Package managers

8. **Maintenance & Growth**
   - Bug fixes
   - Feature updates
   - Security patches
   - Community feedback
   - Analytics review

# Loon Browser

![Loon Browser](assets/loon-browser-logo.svg)

Loon Browser is a Minnesota-themed web browser with advanced features similar to Brave, Arc, or Firefox. Named after Minnesota's state bird, the Common Loon, our browser aims to provide a unique browsing experience that is fast, privacy-focused, and distinctly Minnesotan.

The development process follows a structured approach outlined in the project flowchart.

## Getting Started

There are two parallel paths you can take to start development:

### 1. Electron-based Quick Start
