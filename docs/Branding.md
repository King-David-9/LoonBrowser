# Loon Browser Branding Guidelines

## Brand Story
Loon Browser is named after Minnesota's state bird, the Common Loon. Like the loon, which is known for its exceptional diving ability and distinctive call, Loon Browser aims to dive deep into the web while maintaining a distinctive presence in the browser market.

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Deep Lake Blue**: `#1A5F7A` - Representing Minnesota's 10,000+ lakes
- **Loon Black**: `#252525` - Inspired by the loon's glossy black head
- **North White**: `#F8F8F8` - For the loon's distinctive white markings and winter snow

### Secondary Colors
- **Forest Green**: `#2F5233` - Representing Minnesota's northern forests
- **Autumn Orange**: `#D57500` - For Minnesota's fall colors
- **Iron Range Red**: `#A52422` - Inspired by Minnesota's iron mining heritage

## Typography
- **Headings**: "North" (a fictional name - in reality, use a clean sans-serif like Montserrat)
- **Body**: "Superior" (a fictional name - in reality, use a readable font like Open Sans)

## Logo
The Loon Browser logo features a simplified loon silhouette, often shown on water (represented by the Deep Lake Blue). The logo should be recognizable even at small sizes (like favicons and app icons).

## Design Elements
- **Waves**: Subtle wave patterns can be used as decorative elements, representing lakes
- **North Star**: Minnesota is the "North Star State" - a simple star can be used as an accent
- **Pine Trees**: Simplified pine tree silhouettes can be used in backgrounds or as decorative elements

## Voice & Tone
- **Straightforward**: Like Minnesotans, our communication is direct and honest
- **Friendly**: Maintaining Minnesota's reputation for "nice"
- **Helpful**: Focused on solving problems without unnecessary complexity
- **Reliable**: Like Minnesota's changing but predictable seasons, users can count on us

## Application
These branding elements should be consistently applied across:
- Browser UI
- Website
- Documentation
- Marketing materials
- Community engagement
